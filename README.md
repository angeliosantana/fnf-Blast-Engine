Thunders does a quick light flash and zooms the camera in slightly
Added a quick transition/cutscene to Monster

Week 3:
New pico version
BF does "Hey!" during Philly Nice
Blammed has a cool new colors flash during that sick part of the song

Week 4:
new bf sprite
Better hair physics for Mom/Boyfriend (Maybe even slightly better than Week 7's ðŸ‘€)
Henchmen die during all songs. Yeah :)

Week 5:
Bottom Boppers and GF does "Hey!" animations during Cocoa and Eggnog
On Winter Horrorland, GF bops her head slower in some parts of the song.

Week 6:
On Thorns, the HUD is hidden during the cutscene
Also there's the Background girls being spooky during the "Hey!" parts of the Instrumental

Awards/Achievements
The engine comes with 16 example achievements that you can mess with and learn how it works

Options menu:
You can change Note colors, Delay and Combo Offset, Controls and Preferences there.
On Preferences you can toggle Downscroll, Middlescroll, Anti-Aliasing, Framerate, Low Quality, Note Splashes, Flashing Lights, etc.

Other gameplay features:
When the enemy hits a note, their strum note also glows.

Lag doesn't impact the camera movement and player icon scaling anymore.

Some stuff based on Week 7's changes has been put in (Background colors on Freeplay, Note splashes)
You can reset your Score on Freeplay/Story Mode by pressing Reset button.

You can listen to a song or adjust Scroll Speed/Damage taken/etc. on Freeplay by pressing Space.

Cool new Chart Editor changes and countless bug fixes
You can now chart "Event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.

Your song's BPM can now have decimal values
You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with two example types:

Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress
Hey: Forces a "Hey" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a "Hey!" too.
